Check the bot here [VacBot#4848](https://discordapp.com/users/844918394888388629/)

This is a simple Discord bot to

- Check slots availability manually 
- Register CoWIN slots by district and age group (18+ or 45+)
- Able to get hourly update on open slots if available
- Change yuor age group and district
- Navigate to COWIN site if slot available
- ~~Book an available slot~~

all this with a simple commands.

## Note

On 6th May 2021, CoWin API added caching and rate limits. The public API data would be cached upto 30 minutes, so the alerts wouldn't be so instant in busy areas, which reduced this bot's functionality to being a nice UI for public CoWIN bot in Discord.
